        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p>When you buy pancit canton, it will already contain most of the ingredients you will need!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Sauce</li>
            <li>Powdered seasoning</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Boil 1 and a half cups of water in a pot.</li>
            <li>When water reaches boiling point, put in the pasta. No salt or oil needed.</li>
            <li>Check the softness of the noodles with a fork. To get the perfect texture, take it out just before it is soft enough. Don't worry, the pasta is already ready before you feel like it's ready. Wait a little longer, and your noodles will be overcooked.</li>
            <li>Strain the water and put the noodles on a plate. Add the condiments and seasoning and mix well.</li>
            <li>It is now ready to serve!</li>
